# Project Nexus Documentation

## üìå Overview
Project Nexus is a documentation hub that consolidates my major learnings from the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.  
This repository serves as a reference for backend concepts, tools, and best practices.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Consolidate key learnings from the program.  
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.  
- Provide a reference guide for current and future learners.  
- Encourage collaboration between frontend and backend learners.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies Learned
- **Python & Django**  
- **RESTful APIs** & **GraphQL APIs**  
- **Docker & Containerization**  
- **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)**  

---

## üìö Important Backend Concepts
- Database Design & Optimization  
- Asynchronous Programming (AsyncIO, Celery, RabbitMQ)  
- Caching Strategies (Redis, Memcached)  
- System Design Principles  

---

## ‚ö° Challenges & Solutions
1. **Challenge:** Handling long-running tasks  
   **Solution:** Implemented **Celery + RabbitMQ** for background jobs.  

2. **Challenge:** Database query performance  
   **Solution:** Optimized queries with **indexes** and **Django ORM best practices**.  

3. **Challenge:** Deployment issues  
   **Solution:** Used **Docker & CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployments.  

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
- Write **clean, modular, and testable code**.  
- Always document APIs with **Swagger / Postman collections**.  
- Use **version control (Git)** effectively for collaboration.  
- Security first: validate inputs, sanitize data, and follow authentication best practices.  

---

## ü§ù Collaboration
This project emphasizes collaboration with:  
- **Frontend learners**: who will consume backend APIs.  
- **Backend learners**: for joint coding sessions, debugging, and peer learning.
