Subject: URGENT: Repo history rewrite and mandatory reclone — [Date/Window]

Team,

We will rewrite the git history for `enyasystem/alx-project-nexus` to remove sensitive secrets discovered in the repository's history. This is a destructive operation and requires every contributor to reclone the repository. Please follow these instructions precisely.

Maintenance window (suggested):
- Start: 2025-09-26 09:00 UTC
- End: 2025-09-26 10:00 UTC

If these times don't work, reply immediately with availability.

What will happen

- During the window we'll force-push a cleaned git history that removes the identified secrets.
- All commit SHAs will change. You must stop pushing until you have recloned the repo.

Your action items (before the window)

1) Please create patches or push any in-progress work to a personal fork BEFORE the window. After the purge, you'll need to reapply or rebase.
2) If you have uncommitted local changes, stash or create a patch: `git diff > mywork.patch`.

After the purge (required)

1) Remove or rename your local clone, then reclone:

    git clone https://github.com/enyasystem/alx-project-nexus.git

2) Reapply any saved patches or rebase your branches onto the new history.

Help

If you need assistance migrating your changes, ping @enyasystem or reply to this thread and we will help you rebase or apply patches.

Thank you for handling this promptly. We'll post a follow-up once the push completes and credentials have been rotated.
