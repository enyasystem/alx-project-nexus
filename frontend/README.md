Frontend demo (Vite + React)

Run locally:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Make sure backend is running: python manage.py runserver

Environment:
- VITE_API_URL (default: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api)

Notes:
- This is a minimal polished frontend for demo purposes. Use local media for image uploads during demo unless S3 is configured.
